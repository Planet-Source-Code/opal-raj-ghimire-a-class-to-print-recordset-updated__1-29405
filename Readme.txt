***
Few things to note.
1. If you make rowheight too small the text will be printed in the cell 
one below that cell.

2. If you want to print field names issue 'PrintFields' method. This 
method should always be used before 'PrintOut' method.

3. Font is not handled in class. Therefore font must be set if you
are not going to use the default font of the object.

4. For Column width and alignments see comments in 'ClassSetup' module
of form1.

5. If there is no printer installed in the system, and you try to print
a run time error(482) occures, pls check the presence of printer
before printing.

Although this class is free for all,
IF YOU USE THIS CLASS IN YOUR SOFTWARE
1. A notification is appreciated.
2. Credit me wherever it deserves.
3. If you do that, send me a picture of the form that shows my name.
